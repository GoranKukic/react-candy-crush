#My Developer Portfolio Website ⚡️

### Welcome!

My portfolio site was built from a Gatsby template, so I took notes on how a more experienced dev sets up front-end data flow for a static site. It was also my first time working with Gatsby, and GraphQL.

### What I Changed

- Added external Link buttons to the top and bottom of the site
- Added Nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section
- Added a new section for skills with Canvas icon animation and changed section order
- Swapped project images for iframes with project demo videos on YouTube

### What I Learned

- Gatsby project structure
- To work with Canvas

### Thanks

Thanks to **Jacobo Martinez** - [https://github.com/cobidev](https://github.com/cobidev) for designing this fantastic template. Here's how it looked before I got to it:

#### Here's what the template looked like before, if you're curious:
